class Downloader(object):
    """
    Handles downloads for a parent Watcher.

    Created with a room, a client, and an output directory. Started with start(),
    then call wait() to wait on the underlying Popen process. Wait will return when the
    download process ends, either because the stream has completed, because it timed out,
    or because it was terminated from outside the thread. On POSIX systems, a negative
    return code from wait() signals termination/timeout, however this is not portable.

    Regardless of why the download finished, Watcher still needs to check live status, so
    the only reason why termination vs. completion matters is potentially responding to
    repeated timeouts (e.g. like that time all the streams failed for 4 hours)

    Attributes:
        destdir: final destination for the download
        tempdir: temporary ("active") directory
        outfile: name of the file being written to
        all_files: list of files this downloader has written, eventually will be logged
            when the stream completes

    NOTE: all_files is the only attribute that has any reason to be public

    Properties:
        stream_data: stream data returned by showroom
        protocol: protocol in use, either rtmp or hls (use enum?)
        rtmp_url, lhls_url, hls_url: separate handles for rtmp and hls urls
        timed_out: whether the last wait() timed out

    Methods: (remove this before release)
        start
        wait
        get_info
        is_running -- whether the child process is running
        stop, kill -- usually called from outside the current thread
        update_stream_url -- internal use only
        move_to_dest -- internal use only
        switch_protocol -- don't change protocol, change downloaders

    TODO:
        Logging (e.g. "download has started" or let Watcher handle this)
        Fix ffmpeg logging on Windows without pulling in PATH

    DONE:
        For now, instead of the below, just use rtmp streams:

            Separate downloaders for rtmp and hls streams? That is, if one is failing
            instead of switching the protocol, have Watcher pop off the failing stream
            and make a new downloader, handing the failing downloader off to some
            cleanup thread via queue. Or can we handle all cleanup here?

        Add a wait() function that wraps the internal Popen process and checks for fail
        states without bothering the wrapping Watcher. Raise on failure?

    TESTING:
        hls recording fails awfully. find out why
        For the failure detection to work properly, must ffmpeg be compiled with librtmp? (yes)
